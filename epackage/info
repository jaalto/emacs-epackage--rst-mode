Description: mode for viewing and editing reStructuredText-documents
 This package provides major mode rst-mode, which supports documents
 marked up using the reStructuredText format. Support includes font
 locking as well as some convenience functions for editing. It does
 this by defining a Emacs major mode: rst-mode (ReST). This mode is
 derived from text-mode (and inherits much of it). This package also
 contains:
 .
 - Functions to automatically adjust and cycle the section underline
   decorations;
 - A mode that displays the table of contents and allows you to jump anywhere
   from it;
 - Functions to insert and automatically update a TOC in your source
   document;
 - Font-lock highlighting of notable reStructuredText structures;
 - Some other convenience functions.
 .
 For more information about reStructuredText, see

 .
 This mode was included in Emacs 23.1 in file rst.el
